# Abstract

This document describes briefly the content of font directory of the
`pankyll-theme-newspaper`.  The goal is to not copy and maintain font files,
but to provide a place for the theme to look for font files.

# Fonts

So far the newspaper theme uses the Alegreya font designed by Huerta
Tipográfica a collaborative Argentinian type foundry with a deep respect for
design and typography. Founded in 2009. The font is available under the SIL
OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 for example at
[github](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya)

## Alegreya

From the root of `pankyll-theme-newspaper`:

```bash
export URL=https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya.git
git submodule add -b master $URL static/font/alegreya
git submodule init
```
