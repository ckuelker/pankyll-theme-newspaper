# Introduction

Newspapers are easy to read. The aim of the [Pankyll] theme newspaper is to
give a newspaper like experience by providing a theme with sparse colored text
in an easy to read font displayed in columns. The theme is also well suited for
printing. It has three types of pages: title, blog and doc.

# Installation

Consider using the [pankyll-theme-newspaper-example] skeleton to test out the
theme or to start a new site. However the installation by itself is just
cloning the theme into the `themes` directory.

```bash
cd  project/themes
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ckuelker/pankyll-theme-newspaper.git
```
